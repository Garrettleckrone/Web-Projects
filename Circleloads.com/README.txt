Project: New Website for Circle Logistics, Inc.
Description: 
	I created this WordPress website during my internship for my employer: Circle Logistics, Inc. 
	The previous website can be found at URL://Circledelivers.com
	The new website can be found at URL://Circleloads.com
	
	This project was a fantastic way to gain experience with web design for a professional organization during my internship with Circle Logistics.
	I was able to work on this for both my Web Design 1 & 2 courses and also while attending the internship.
	I'm very happy with the results, and even more progress has been made than what is shown in the PDFs in this respository.
	
	Please see the above Circleloads.com for the most recent updates.

	Thank you, 
	Garrett Leckrone.
